# Roo AI Assistant Ignore File
#
# This file specifies files and directories that the AI assistant should ignore.
# It helps prevent the assistant from accessing sensitive data, large files,
# or irrelevant parts of the project.
#
# The syntax is similar to .gitignore.
# Each line is a pattern.
# - `*` matches everything.
# - `!` negates a pattern, allowing you to un-ignore a file or directory.

# By default, ignore everything to ensure safety and focus.
*

# To allow the assistant to access specific files or directories,
# use the `!` prefix.
#
# Example: Allow access to the 'src' directory.
# !src/
#
# Example: Allow access to a specific file.
# !src/main.py
